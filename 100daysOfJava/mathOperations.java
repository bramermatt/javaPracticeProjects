    **  Day 7 - Math Operations (https://www.100daysofcode.io/learn/java/math-operations)
        Write a program that performs the following tasks using Math class:

        Maximum of 2 numbers
        Minimum of 2 numbers
        Square root of a number
        Floor and Ceil of a float
        Abs value of a double

    **  Why is this important?
    This exercise is important for real-world applications because it introduces fundamental programming concepts using the Math class, which is widely used across various domains in software development. Here's why each task is relevant:

    Maximum of 2 Numbers:
        Applications: Determining the higher value between two inputs is common in scenarios like financial comparisons (e.g., choosing the better investment), gaming (e.g., finding the highest score), or algorithm optimization (e.g., picking the best path).
        Real-World Example: In a stock trading app, you may need to compare two stock prices to decide which one to sell for higher profit.

    Minimum of 2 Numbers:
        Applications: Finding the smaller value is useful in cost minimization, optimization problems, or resource management.
        Real-World Example: In logistics, selecting the route with the lowest delivery time or cost.

    Square Root of a Number:
        Applications: Square roots are essential in geometry, physics, engineering, and statistical calculations.
        Real-World Example: Calculating the diagonal of a screen given its width and height (Pythagoras theorem).

    Floor and Ceil of a Float:
        Applications: Floor and ceiling functions are critical in discrete mathematics, rounding errors, or pricing calculations.
        Real-World Example: In e-commerce, rounding up a calculated shipping weight to the next whole kilogram for pricing.

    Absolute Value of a Double:
        Applications: Absolute values are used in distance calculations, error handling, and ensuring non-negative results.
        Real-World Example: In finance, calculating the absolute change in stock prices to evaluate volatility.
